# Learning Goals

## 1. Greater Understanding of jQuery

I want to gain a greater understanding of jQuery throughout the duration of this uni and learn to implement it into real-life situations such as Apps & Websites. With the previous unit in Level 1, It gave an Introduction to jQuery which i'd like to discover further.

This is an important goal that I hope to achieve as it means that my possibilities for any future projects can be expanded and I can learn to play with the code and the websites behaviour to create a better experience for the user. 

I intend to achieve this goal by attending all the sessions and taking on-board the extra resources outside of the lectures to get a deeper understanding of the way in which the code is written and ways that this can be used to achieve a curtain outcome.


## 2. Get familiar with API's

Last year in Level 1, we had an Introduction to What an API was and how it can be used to get information from a database. We applied this to a Recipe Search Engine site that would display the image, and name of recipe. I found this very useful as I could see it used for a purpose.

I feel that this is an important goal to understand further how websites pull information from databases through API's. This is also important because more and more API's are being developed and therefore are becoming an important/fundamental part of some site's content. 

I intend to achieve this by downloading free API's and then


## 3. Experiment with Code (Outside of Comfort-Zone)

I want to experiment with my code and test new ways to code and learn new methods such as jQuery and using API's for a practical use rather than for fun like we did previously. I'd love to push myself outside of my Comfort Zone and try and do things that when I started this course at the end of 2014, I thought I would never be able to do. Although i don't want to go down the route of Web Development, I feel that gaining an understanding of how to code and code effectively and well, is important to understanding my future peers within organisations I hope to work for. I plan to use websites such as Code Wars to test my bailies within Javascript to solve puzzles and bugs to better my understanding.
