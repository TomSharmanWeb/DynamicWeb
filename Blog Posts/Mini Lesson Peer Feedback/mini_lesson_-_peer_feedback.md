#Mini Lesson - Peer Feedback

Ade, Johan and myself have presented a Mini Lesson on "Below The API", how companies are replacing middle management levels in their organisations through the introduction of bots and machines to automate the process. A great example that we gave was Uber removing the Controller who organises the cab drivers jobs. Many other companies such as Google and Amazon are testing ways in which they can pursue this growing trend.

### My Feedback to Them

We received feedback from our peers, Harry and Jonny who did theirs on The Critical Coders Manifesto. I gave them some feedback, and they did for me. Here's what feedback I gave them:

- Great Presentation, really well explained.
- I loved the way you simplified what could be a very long drawn out and tedious subject. It was great that you only picked out the most important and relevant information for us, and told it in a way which was interesting and engaging.
- It was nice to see a presentation, not using Google Slides or Microsoft Powerpoint. Telling it through GitHub was a nice change, and also very handy to refer back to If I ever needed to use it.

#### Their Feedback to Me

Hopefully Jonny & Harry find this Feedback useful to better their future presentations and projects. They also gave me some feedback for our groups Mini-Lesson Presentation on "Below The API". Here is the feedback:

- Very Good use of making it relatable by adding credible case studies from well known companies that our relevant to our Industry.
- A well formatted presentation that told a story/journey.
- Good use of images and visuals in the presentation. Much nicer than it being text heavy and someone reading from a screen.
- Notes seemed to be very good, was well prepared and spoke clearly and confidently.


With this feedback, we can use it to learn and develop how we presented to improve any future presentations or 'Mini-Lessons' that we may do. I love the feedback that they gave in regards to using "credible case studies from well known companies that our relevant to our industry". We as a group felt it was important to try and read outside of the topic a little and relate it as much to the industry we are going into and use case studies that everyone is familiar with, to make it relatable and easier to follow/understand.

We tried to deliver the mini-lesson in an engaging way through visuals and images, rather than text heavy. This proved to be effective due to our feedback we received. We also tried to make it engaging by using expressive body language and speak confident and clearly. I personally felt that not only myself, but the whole team did this to a high standard.

An improvement that we could make for future presentations, would be not to rush it. I felt that often things were rushed and we spoke quickly through some slides. This could lead to some confusion. I know that from informal feedback from others that this was an issue.
