#Progress With Code

Throughoutout the Dynamic Web Unit, I am going to be documenting my experience learning jQuery and implementing API's into code. This process is taught in a term and will show different methods of how I learnt jQuery. I aim to show how i am progressing and expanding my knowledge of programming. 

I have discussed my [Learning Goals]() for this unit. This lists three things in which I hope to achieve or understand throughout the process of this project.

- [Lecture 1: Introduction to API's][2]
- [Lecture 2: Below the API Presentation][3]
