#Formative Assessment Reflection 

Blog

Individually, reflect on the feedback you received during the formative assessment, as well as your experience in this unit so far, and write about it.

Your post should address these questions (in no particular order):

ME:

How and what did I learn?
What worked and what didn't?
Did I reach my goals, why or why not?
How did I feel during the process?
My TEAM:

How did the team perform?
What worked and what didn't?
What can we do better next time?
Did the team reach the goal?
Was there conflict, how do we fix it?

## Feedback Received

**Matteo:**
our filter bubbles, nice mind map to illustrate ideas generation process
why Xmas? affects everybody but people have different experiences (filter bubbles), Xmas is a global phenomenon but it creates bubbles
information design: using colour meaningfully
use open-source code and adapt it to your purpose
bit.ly/hashtagXmas
explain the tech: how does it work* 

**Aidan:** Clear visual support, good reasoning behind Instagram, nice idea for visualising it (branching off through circles)
Jack: good breakdown of how they came to a decision, good mind map to break down ideas, need to make more eye contact rather than speaking to the screen, Johan needs to learn to hold a remote, good to relate back to filter bubbles and how it's relevant, like the idea of different languages.

**Jonny:** Nice way of exploring cultural differences

**Rana:** nice mind map, good reason behind choosing christmas, the whole team is interested in it, fun subject

**Metod:** Showing research through a mind map. Explaining the concept well! Talking about the theme through different experiences—talking about personal stories (really good approach in presentations). All three presenters are engaged and handover the presentations tasks. Visually a very good circularly-dividing interactive graphic. Reservation re a circle, because different words will have different lengths and will sometimes run outside the circle?!
Ryder:Nice to see a html mockup.

**Joe:** Good presentation, the mockups looked really good. I reckon that displaying Instagram images within each circle would be a really good idea. By doing that you’ll be able to show a brilliant snapshot of what christmas looks like visually in different countries as well as just showing hashtags. This’ll probably increase the size of your audience as well if you plan on releasing the project to the public online.
