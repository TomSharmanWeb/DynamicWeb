## The Introduction

### What is HashTagChristmas?
HashTagChristmas is a student project from three second year Web Media students at Ravensbourne, London. Our aim for this project was to go against showing filter bubbles for an individual, but rather, for a langauge. 


### How Does it work?
We are using the Instagram API to search for the 4 most popular hashtags used in combination with #Christmas over the most recent 400 posts. You can them repeat this pattern.

### Why did you do this?
We feel that everyone has a different experience of Christmas, and it's often very personal and specific to a country, relgion, area or family. We wanted to group these personal experiences together in a way which celebrates everyone filter bubbles.
